## Introduction

^ When we are talking about cryptography these are the key terms and more important concepts for introducing.

^ We will see that the key is a secret shared between emisor and receptor.

^ The most important point is the cipher, that is ,the algorithm that converts plaintext in ciphertext

^ We have more advanced terms like salt, initialization vector and derived key.

^ These terms are used internally in the algorithm for generating the ciphertext

^ The idea of these terms are make as random as possible the generation of the key and avoid or prevent brute force attacks by rainbow tables or dictionary.

```objectivec

^ The salt creates a random string and prepend it to passwords to make brute forcing harder
^ A salt is a random sequence added to the password string before using the hash function. The salt is used in order to prevent dictionary attacks and rainbow tables attacks
